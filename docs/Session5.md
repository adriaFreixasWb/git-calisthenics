# Solving conflicts using a diff tool

On [session 3: managing-conflicts](/docs/Session3.md#managing-conflicts)
we saw a first way to deal with conflicts. To improve our experience, we are going to learn how to use a diff tool.

[Git diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) is a way to see difference of a range of things, from two different files to two different branches. 
But what we mean by using a diff tool is to have a text editor equipped to handle the conflicts on a specific file. 
For our current session we will use [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
