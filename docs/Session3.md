# Conflict resolution

Up to now it's been pretty straight forward, change source code, stage changes, commit, push, merge. What happens when we try to marge two branches and the changes is not fast-forward?

## Getting branches ready

In this instance we are going to emulate 2 different developers working at the same time.

Create a [new branch](Session2.md#Branching) but don't check it our yet.
Now make changes on your README.md, stage them and commit.
